Apoptosis is a multiplayer Real-Time-Strategy where the battles take place in the world of the microscopic. The player takes control of a group of cells with varied attributes and taking advantage of the environment and the ability to replicate - attempts to destroy the opponent's cells. 

The player begins the game with the basic type of cells and aims to increase their number as soon as possible, while the opponent does the same. Cells have a store of protein which they use to stay alive and split. 

The player selects, controls and orders his units around the battle map seeking more advantageous areas.
